## Description

A program for generating a readme file from the console.

## Installation

Requires inquirer to be installed

## Usage

Used to make a quality readme file with minimal effort. Useful if you're like me and don't enjoy writing the formatting for a readme every time you make a new repo.

## Credits

This was a solo endeavor.
