## Description

Sometimes you want to make a quality readme but really don't want to put in much effort. This app is here for that. This is a command-line application that prompts you with questions to fill out a template readme file. There is an example readme in the output file. Any readme you make with this app is put into the output folder.

## Installation

This app has inquirer as a dependency. To use it you also need to have Node on your computer. Once the repo has been cloned, you need to run npm install in order to have inquirer available.

---

## Usage

The program makes a readme with information you provide as it asks you questions in the command-line. It includes questions about your github username, a description of the project, a table of contents, intallation guidelines, what the use case for the project is, what license you are using, how to contribute, tests, and makes a section for people to ask you questions via github or email.

## Contribution guidelines

If you'd like to contribute, Project is complete from my view, but if you would like to send me suggestions to imporve it feel free to make an issue and I will try to get around to it. If you'd rather fix it yourself then by all means, clone the repo and fix whatever bothers you.
